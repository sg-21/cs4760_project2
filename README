# Assignment 2: Concurrent UNIX Processes and shared memory
# Due: March 1st 2021


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brief Description: 

The goal of this homework is to become familiar with concurrent processing in Linux using shared memory.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Invoking the solution:

master should take in several command line options as follows:

master -h master [-h] [-s i] [-t time] datafile

-h          Describe how the project should be run and then, terminate.
-s x        Indicate the number of children allowed to exist in the system at the same time.  (Default 20)
-t time     The time in seconds after which the process will terminate, even if it has not finished.  (Default 100)
datafile    Input file containing one integer on each line.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to run the project: 

First, you will need to type "make" into the command prompt.
This will create the necessary .o files as well as the executable files.
Then, you type ./master followed by any of the above options. *if no datafile is given, an error message will be prompted*
Now, the program will run as expected.
To clean the project, type "make clean".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issues and problems with the program:

The most obvious issue here is that the program does not run fully. I was not able to complete bin_adder to have the bakery algorithm.
This led to bigger issues with the code as a whole, and thus I could not finish it.
I spent extra time on the project to try and figure it out, but I could not get it down.
I had the project running using a different algorithm, however, since the requirements were for bakery algorithm or no grade for the algorithm at all, 
I decided to just leave the working code out and turn it in as is.


*Edit*

I am resubmitting this project for the final time, as I tried to figure out the bakery algorithm.
I was able to compile something, however, I don't believe this is correct.
When I had something running before, using a different algorithm, the output was much more advanced.
However, I decided to go with this as it is something and I tried to incorporate the bakery algorithm. 
One element I struggled with and could not figure out for whatever reason was the two log files.
