# Assignment 2: Concurrent UNIX Processes and shared memory
# Due: March 1st 2021

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brief Description: 

The goal of this homework is to become familiar with concurrent processing in Linux using shared memory.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Invoking the solution:

master should take in several command line options as follows:

master -h master [-h] [-s i] [-t time] datafile

-h          Describe how the project should be run and then, terminate.
-s x        Indicate the number of children allowed to exist in the system at the same time.  (Default 20)
-t time     The time in seconds after which the process will terminate, even if it has not finished.  (Default 100)
datafile    Input file containing one integer on each line.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to run the project: 

First, you will need to type "make" into the command prompt.
This will create the necessary .o files as well as the executable files.
Then, you type ./master followed by any of the above options. *if no datafile is given, an error message will be prompted*
Now, the program will run as expected.
To clean the project, type "make clean".
